# EXEC_OVERLANG

A framework for providing data lookups in a sidebar window in emulated games, such as for translation comparison in livestreams. Reference implementation is configured for English-to-Japanese comparison of Ar Tonelico 2, which inspired the name.

This uses https://github.com/qwertystop/gdextension-pine to read emulated memory.

The ripped AT2 scripts themselves are not included for reasons of copyright safety.
